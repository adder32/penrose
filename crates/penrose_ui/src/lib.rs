//! # Penrose-ui: a bare bones toolkit for adding UI elements to Penrose
//!
//! ## A note on the intended purpose of this crate
//! Penrose-ui is not intended as a general purpose UI library. It is incredibly minimal in the
//! functionality it provides and is primarily designed to provide a built-in status bar for the
//! [penrose][0] tiling window manager library. While it should be possible to make use of this
//! crate for writing UIs without integrating with penrose, that is certainly not the intended
//! use case and is not fully supported.
//!
//! ## Getting started
//! The main functionality of this crate is provided through the [`Draw`] nad [`Context`] structs
//! which allow for simple graphics rendering backed by the [pango][1] and [cairo][2] libraries.
